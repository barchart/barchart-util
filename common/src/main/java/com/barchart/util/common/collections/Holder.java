/**
 * A mutable object that may contain a reference to another object. An instance
 * of this type either holds some non-null reference, or holds nothing; it is
 * never said to "hold {@code null}". The instance that is held can be set,
 * unset or changed at any time.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is the mutable version of {@link Optional}. It is also very
 * similar to {@link AtomicReference} (without the atomic operations and
 * thread-safety).
 *
 * <p>
 * One common use of a {@code Holder} is to receive a result from an anonymous
 * inner class:
 * 
 * <pre class="code">
 *    {@code
 *
 *   final Holder<Result> resultHolder = Holder.absent();
 *   doIt(new InnerClass() {
 *     public void foo() {
 *       Result result = ...
 *       resultHolder.set(result);
 *     }
 *   });}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> two {@code Holder} instances are never considered equal, even if
 * they are holding the same instance at the time.
